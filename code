		"description": "The name Chippendales may sound like the popular Disney cartoon characters who received their own movie on Disney+ in May 2022. However, this name refers to a male stripper troupe that was popular in the late '70s and early '80s before going downhill due to a mix of greed, betrayal, and even murder.
                    In May 2021, Hulu, a streaming service that funnily enough is mostly owned by Disney, announced that they were working on a biographical miniseries about Chippendales founder Somen “Steve” Banerjee, played by Kumail Nanjiani, called Welcome to Chippendales (formerly titled Immigrant). Based on the book Deadly Dance: The Chippendales Murders by K. Scot Macdonald and Patrick MontesDeOca, this show joins a growing lineup of biographical miniseries on Hulu that includes Pam & Tommy, Dopesick, and The Act. Nanjiani also serves as an executive producer for the show, alongside his wife and frequent collaborator Emily V. Gordon.",

		"description": "In the newly-released trailer for Welcome to Chippendales, a character is shown saying, “You’re a bad man, Mr. Banerjee,” and that pretty much sums up the entire series. This forthcoming Hulu original explores the true crime story behind the famous male stripper revue, Chippendales, which was founded by Somen “Steve” Banerjee.
                    The entrepreneur found success in the company, following two failed businesses, and refused to let anything get in his way. This might explain why he was later convicted for attempted arson, racketeering, and murder for hire.",
